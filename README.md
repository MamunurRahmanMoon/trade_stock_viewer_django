# All the new things for me in this project:
  > Handling json file in django project

  > File import export Chart in django project

# New module/framework learnt:
> django-import-export module
 
> chart.js

# Issues I faced:
> Loading data to sql server: json file string format was not accepted by the django models, that's why had to work with csv file after preprocessing the csv file
 
> Working with charts: First approach was to use Plotly (python library) to generate charts.Due to lack of quality learning resources, I decided to use Chart.js

> Because of large amount of data the chart is not loading properly

> Trying to learn more about chart.js and how to integrate properly in a django project.
